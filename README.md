# Minnehack2025

## VolunTier

### ProjectFeatures/Goals
- One user can generate a volunteer event
- Other users can apply/join as part to help out
- This system is then gamified into a leaderboard within the local community (for example MSP downtown, Edina, etc.) to do goodwill
- Will set this up as a 401(c)3 business so that we can accept donations and reimburse top performers in volunteering by community
- Need: Either mobile interface, or web interface. Backend: MongoDB, express, node
- Which roads are closed/where traffic will build up 
- Where resources can be found (freshwater/food shipments into local businesses) 
- Emergency situation posting if help is needed from the general public (clearing up wreckage).
- Mobile interface: Swift, Backend: MongoDB, Express, Node
